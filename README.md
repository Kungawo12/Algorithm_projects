There will be one multi-deliverable Java programming project this semester, which will be divided into
five separately-graded program deliverables (DelivA through Deliv E). A specification for each
deliverable will be uploaded on or before the date listed for “Del<x> out” in the syllabus.
The Project: Graph Manipulations
All five program deliverables involve manipulating a graph encoded as described below. For each
deliverable, you add functionality to the graph as encoded in the “initial codebase” that I give you.
Start from a Working Program
Some programs work on student computers but not on University (Windows) computers or my MacBook
pro computer.1 So you are given an initial codebase, “Prog340”, that compiles and runs on all platforms.
 It opens a menu for you to select an action. It has a number of predefined menu items describing the
various actions (which you will implement during the semester).
o When you start the program the first action you will want to take will be to read a file. The input
files for all deliverables have the same, specified format.
o It allows you to continuously select actions as long as you wish, including read another file.
 It allows you to exit the program.
Each Deliverable will involve your modifying your existing program (DelivA involves modifying the
initial codebase given to you). This minimizes any duplicate effort. But it means that if you screw up a
deliverable, you may have screwed up another deliverable later in the course
